This file is the open-source code for 'Brain-inspired bodily self-perception model for robot rubber hand illusion', mainly used in simulation environments, and can reproduce various rubber hand illusion experiments.

## RHI_BrainCog

We are building an open source spiking neural network based brain-inspired cognitive intelligence engine for Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence and brain simulation. Therefore, we also implemented the core Proprioceptive drift experiment of the rubber hand illusion experiment using Braincog.

[The open source code built by BrainCog](https://github.com/BrainCog-X/Brain-Cog/tree/main/examples/Embodied_Cognition/RHI)

BrainCog provides essential and fundamental components to model biological and artificial intelligence. The current version of BrainCog contains at least 18 functional spiking neural network algorithms (including but not limited to perception and learning, decision making, knowledge representation and reasoning, motor control, social cognition, etc.) built based on BrainCog infrastructures, and BrainCog also provide brain simulations to drosophila, rodent, monkey, and human brains at multiple scales based on spiking neural networks at multiple scales.
